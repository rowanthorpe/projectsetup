Being a one-script project, this is trivially easy to install and use. Just
copy projectsetup.sh to somewhere in your PATH (or call it by pathname from
anywhere you want). Other than a POSIX shell and the basic POSIX tools, you
only need virtualenvwrapper (and virtualenv) if you activate it with the
appropriate option, and other tools only if your recipe actually calls them
(e.g. _pysub requires python and some modules, etc...).
